# QWZ-0.11: Tag Release and Verify Success Metrics

## User Story

As a developer, I want to tag the QWZ-0 epic as a release and verify all success metrics are met, so that the project foundation is complete and ready for feature development.

## Description

Complete the QWZ-0 epic by creating a git tag for the release, verifying all acceptance criteria across all 11 user stories are met, and documenting the project state. This marks the end of the project foundation phase and the beginning of feature development (QWZ-1+).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 11 user stories in QWZ-0 are complete and verified
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes with zero errors on both frontend and backend
- [ ] `npm run format:check` passes with zero formatting issues
- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully in both frontend and backend
- [ ] `npm run start` runs without errors in frontend
- [ ] `npm run start:dev` runs without errors in backend
- [ ] Git repository is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Git tag `v0.0.0-qwz-0-foundation` created with descriptive message
- [ ] Tag is pushed to remote repository
- [ ] README.md updated with project overview and setup instructions
- [ ] All success metrics from QWZ-0 epic are verified and documented

## Technical Notes

### Pre-Release Verification Checklist

Run these commands from monorepo root to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Check code quality
npm run lint

# 2. Check formatting
npm run format:check

# 3. Build frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..

# 4. Build backend
cd backend
npm run build
cd ..

# 5. Verify git status
git status

# 6. Verify all changes are committed
git log --oneline -5
```

### Git Tag Creation

Create an annotated tag with a descriptive message:

```bash
git tag -a v0.0.0-qwz-0-foundation -m "QWZ-0: Project Foundation & Monorepo Setup

- Monorepo structure with npm workspaces
- Angular 20 frontend with standalone components, zoneless change detection, NgRx
- NestJS backend with TypeScript strict mode, ConfigModule
- Environment configuration for dev/prod in both frontend and backend
- ESLint and Prettier configured across monorepo
- HTTP client with interceptors (base URL, error handling, loading state)
- Backend folder structure (config, common, database, domain modules)
- Ready for feature development (QWZ-1+)"
```

### Push Tag to Remote

```bash
git push origin v0.0.0-qwz-0-foundation
```

### README.md Update

Update `qwizz-app/README.md` with project overview and setup instructions.

### Success Metrics Verification

Document success metrics in a `QWZ-0-SUCCESS-METRICS.md` file.

### Next Phase

QWZ-1: Shared TypeScript Types & Database Schema

- Define shared type contracts between frontend and backend
- Set up PostgreSQL database schema
- Configure TypeORM entities and migrations

### Verification Steps

1. Run all verification commands above
2. Ensure git status is clean
3. Create annotated git tag with descriptive message
4. Push tag to remote
5. Update README.md with project overview
6. Create QWZ-0-SUCCESS-METRICS.md documenting completion

## Dependencies

All 10 previous user stories (QWZ-0.01 through QWZ-0.10)

## Effort Estimate: S

## Notes

- This is the final user story of QWZ-0 epic
- Tag version follows semantic versioning: `v0.0.0-qwz-0-foundation`
- Success metrics document serves as project completion report
- README.md provides entry point for new developers
- All code is ready for feature development in QWZ-1+
